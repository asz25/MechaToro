Students are now able to attain the requirement of three (3) or more years of credits or full-time attendance at these additional institutions based on unit completion or class hours per year:\n\nCalifornia adult schools established by any of the following entities:\n- A county office of education\n- A unified school district or high school district\n- The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation\n\nCampuses of the California Community Colleges\n\nStudents who don’t graduate from a California high school may also:\n\n- Attain an associate degree from a campus of the California Community Colleges\n\nOR\n\n- Fulfill the minimum transfer requirements established for the University of California (UC) or the California State University (CSU) when transferring from a campus of the California Community Colleges\n\nThe California Dream Act Application is for:\n\n- Undocumented students who meet AB 540/AB 2000/SB 68 criteria\n- U visa holders\n- AB 540 eligible students who hold a Social Security Card obtained through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA); DACA holders are not eligible noncitizens\n\nAB 540 undocumented students should fill out only one application, the California Dream Act Application, and not the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).",
